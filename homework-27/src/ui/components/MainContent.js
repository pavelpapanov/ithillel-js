          <p>Welcome to the React documentation! This page will give you an introduction to the 80% of React concepts
            that you will use on a daily basis.</p>

          <h3>Creating and nesting components</h3>
          <p>React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own
            logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.</p>
          <h3>Writing markup with JSX</h3>
          <p>The markup syntax youâ€™ve seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its
            convenience. All of the tools we recommend for local development support JSX out of the box.</p>
