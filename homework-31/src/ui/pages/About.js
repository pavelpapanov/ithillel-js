        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Since 2011, HERoines Inc. has been helping women, young and old, create the lives they want to live through
          events, girl talk, books, videos and more that support and empower them to follow their dreams.</p>
        <p>We help them embark on a journey of finding their true selves by organizing events that discuss women’s
          issues with the help of women who share their experiences. Our events are a mix of girl talk and fun. There
          are also signature events that happen every year such as #UnWined, Heels Class for a Cure, and
          #ImprovYourself. These signature events are led by a guest speaker who has had a breakthrough in the presented
          topic. She’ll speak about her personal experiences followed by hands-on games, activities, and open
          conversations. And, of course, there’s wine and delicious appetizers.</p>
